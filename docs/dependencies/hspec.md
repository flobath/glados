# hspec Dependency

This document aims to provide an overview of the benefits of using [hspec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec) Haskell dependency in the project development.

## Benefits

1. **Behavior-Driven Development**: The `hspec` package provides a framework for behavior-driven development (BDD), which helps in writing clear and understandable tests.

2. **Performance**: Optimized for performance, the `hspec` package includes efficient implementations of common testing operations.

3. **Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with a wide range of Haskell tools and libraries, making it easier to integrate with other dependencies.

4. **Stability**: The `hspec` package is maintained by the Haskell community and is known for its stability and reliability.

5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is available, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the functions and modules provided by the `hspec` package.
