# base Dependency
This document aims to provide an overview of the benefits of using [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) Haskell dependency in the project development.

## Benefits

1. **Standard Library**: The `base` package includes the standard library for Haskell, providing essential modules and functions that are fundamental for Haskell programming.

2. **Stability**: The `base` package is maintained by the Haskell community and is known for its stability and reliability.

3. **Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with a wide range of Haskell tools and libraries, making it easier to integrate with other dependencies.

4. **Performance**: Optimized for performance, the `base` package includes efficient implementations of common data structures and algorithms.

5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is available, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the functions and modules provided by the `base` package.
