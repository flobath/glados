# Continuous Integration (CI)

This document outlines the setup and advantages of the CI implemented using GitHub Actions for the GLaDOS project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this CI setup is to streamline the development workflow by automating the process of testing and building the application. This ensures that every code change is validated through a series of automated checks, maintaining the integrity and quality of the codebase.

## Advantages

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures that all code changes are automatically tested, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Consistent Builds**: Provides a consistent and repeatable build process, ensuring that the application can be reliably built and deployed.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Identifies issues early in the development process, making them easier to fix.
- **Faster Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on the status of the code, allowing for quicker iterations and improvements.
- **Increased Productivity**: Automates repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on more complex and value-adding activities.
