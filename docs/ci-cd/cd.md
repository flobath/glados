# Continuous Delivery (CD)

This document outlines the setup and advantages of the CD implemented using GitHub Actions for the GLaDOS project.

## Purpose

The purpose of using Continuous Delivery (CD) is to ensure that the GLaDOS project can be reliably released at any time. CD automates the deployment process, allowing for more frequent and predictable releases. This reduces the risk of errors, ensures that new features and fixes are delivered to users quickly, and improves the overall quality of the software.

## Advantages

- **Ease of Use**: Automated deployment give users a fully functional version of the software without needing them to build it by themselves.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Automating the deployment process allows for quicker releases, enabling faster delivery of new features and bug fixes to users.
- **Reduced Risk**: Automated deployments reduce the chances of human error, making the release process more reliable and less prone to mistakes.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Developers can focus on writing code rather than managing deployments, leading to better productivity and more efficient use of resources.
- **Better Collaboration**: CD encourages collaboration among team members by providing a consistent and automated deployment pipeline.
