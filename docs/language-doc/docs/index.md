# Welcome to FunChill documentation

Welcome to the FunChill programming language documentation! If this is your first time here, you should certainly have a look to the [introduction to FunChill](./introduction.md).

You can then explore more in depth features by navigating from the introduction page, or go to straight to the [language reference](./reference/) for an index of the reference pages.

Have fun, and stay chill!
