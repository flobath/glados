# About FunChill

FunChill has been created as a school project by 5 Epitech students. It is designed to be easy to use, and also decently easy to implement, since we obviously have to respect a due date.

The main idea throughout the FunChill design is that everything should be *chill*: nothing should be horrendously long to write, nor unreadable for no reason.

It's an accumulation of simple decisions that keep the language simple to use. A good example of that is that semicolons at end of statement are optional, a simple linebreak works too.  
The `fun` keyword aims at being a nice little reminder that you should always try to have fun and enjoy the time you spend programming.
